= Walkabout - Shoes 3.3
  The name reflects back to when Shoes creator why_the_lucky_stiff disappeared
  from the internet. He went walkabout! We changed some icons and backgrounds
  to relect that whimsical theme.  
  
  Walkabout (3.3) will be less compatible with the unmaintained 3.1 and 4.0 (jRuby)
  We have interesting ideas of we what we do with Shoes that maybe very difficult
  to immplememt in Shoes 4. 

=== new with 3.3.0
  * Uses Gtk3 (not gtk2) for Linux and Windows. This will change visuals
    on both platorms. 
  * add font and wrap styles for list_box. A popular request - we are
    limited to what Gtk3 can do, however. 
    The default behaviour for long strings in the list box is now to 
    ellispise ... in the middle. THIS could effect your current apps.
    Issue 109 https://github.com/Shoes3/shoes3/issues/109
  * A new Svg widget to display svg images - similar to Image but 
    NOT the same. Has aspect scaling options based on the svg internals.
    See samples/good-svgview.rb. samples/good-flip.rb and the manual. 
    We also include a svg deck of playing cards. 
    It's a  bit fragile  so please file bug reports and feature requests.
