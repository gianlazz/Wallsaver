#Wallsaver App
Wallsaver is written in ruby with ruby shoes for the GUI. It gives you the ability to enable/disable your screensaver on your Mac simply by pressing a button.

#How It Works
Wallsaver runs some console commands in the background from a simple ui to either initiate your screensaver as your wallpaper or revert it back to normal.

#Ruby Shoes
Wallsaver is programmed in Ruby and made with the open source project "Ruby Shoes".
